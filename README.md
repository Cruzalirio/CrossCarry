## Installation

You can install the stable release from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("CrossCarry")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Cruzalirio/CrossCarry")
```

---

## Basic Example

The package provides tools to analyze crossover designs with carry-over effects using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE).

```r
library(CrossCarry)
data("Arterial")

# Create carry-over dummies
cc <- createCarry(data = Arterial, treatment = "Treatment", 
                  period = "Period", id = "Subject", carrySimple = TRUE)

# Fit a basic GEE model
fit <- CrossGEE(response = "Pressure", treatment = "Treatment", 
                period = "Period", id = "Subject", 
                carry = cc$carryover, data = cc$data,
                correlation = "AR-M", Mv = 1)

# Print model QIC criteria
fit$QIC
```

## Applications

CrossCarry has been applied in different contexts:

- **Biomedical trials**: estimation of treatment and carry-over effects in blood pressure crossover studies.
- **Nutrition and cognition**: water supplementation trial in schoolchildren.
- **Methodological research**: simulation studies comparing correlation structures in GEE.
- **Ongoing work**: penalized GEE for spline-based carry-over effects, with applications in pharmacology.
